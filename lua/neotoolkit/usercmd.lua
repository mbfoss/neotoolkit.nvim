-- This module does no argument parsing of its own: completion runs the raw
-- command line back through nvim_parse_cmd, so it splits by Vim's native rules
-- (:h <f-args>):
--
--   Arguments are separated by unescaped whitespace. A backslash escapes the
--   character after it: \<space> (or \<tab>) is that literal whitespace and
--   does not split the argument, \\ is a single backslash, and a backslash
--   before anything else -- including a trailing backslash at end of line --
--   is kept verbatim along with what follows it. Quotes are not special.
--
--     a\ b c   -> a b  and  c        a\\b     -> a\b
--     a\\\ b   -> a\ b               a\nb     -> a\nb
--     \ a      -> " a"               a\       -> a\
--     "a b"    -> "a  and  b"        --p=x\ y -> --p=x y
